  <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h2>

  <p>My strengths include my creatvity, my burst of energy and my ability to learn quickly.
      <br>
    My limitations are my ability to keep on task in a timely manner without getting distracted by issues that pop up. 
    I have a lot of creative ideas that I have trouble editing down. For this reason I have difficulty refining my ideas into one achievable path that I am committed to from start to fininsh. 
    Quite often what this means for me is that I will flit between two different methods or ideas, meaning that I am doing double the work that is expected of me and coming away with the results of just one. 
    Being more decisive as early as possible will help save my own time and effort.

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>

<p>I expect clear communication and balanced support when needed.
  I like how Engie and Kelly are active on Slack. 
  Ideally, the facilitators should be present and available in the event that we need anything and by having them both active on slack reminds me that they are 
  more available and open to contact in case we need anything. 

  I know that both Engie and Kelly are busy people, but I would hope that if we message them for help, that they will respond within a day or two at the latest.
    </p>

<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
    </h2>
<p>I work full-time so I only really do my work in the evenings or weekends. 
  This means that the times I work on my sprints should be time specifically set aside. 
  These timeblocks should be intentional and purposeful to ensure that the time I invest is 
  of high quality and is of maximum efficiency.

<h2>How and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
<p>By being active in slack and the groups I'm apart of. 
  Also by seeking out help on the internet when necessary.
  One of my problems is that I don't hold myself accountable for the time I spend finding answers to the problems I'm havinf in terminal or with my code.
  For example, I will pause my Toggle timer because me finding the solution to whatever I think is wrong is not directly related to the challenge. 
  So I can spend HOURS figuring out what is wrong and how to solve it. 
  From here on out, I will keep myself accountable for that wasted time by NOT pausing my Toggle in case issues pop up. 
  This means that the time I spend will be more intentional and hopefully more efficient.
