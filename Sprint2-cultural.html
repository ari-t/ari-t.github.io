  <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h2>

  <p>My strengths include my creatvity, my burst of energy and my ability to learn quickly.
      <br>
    My limitations are my ability to keep on task in a timely manner without getting distracted by issues that pop up. 
  
  
    </p>

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>

<p>I expect clear communication and balanced support when needed.
  Ideally, the facilitators should be present and available in the event that we need anything and by having them both active on slack reminds me that they are 
  more available and open to contact in case we need anything. 

  I expect the teachers to anticipate the parts of the course that may require more effort and deliver the lessons accordingly.
  I would hope that the teachers are approachable and easy to communicate with.
    </p>

<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
    </h2>
<p>  I will be juggling part-time work commitments while doing this course, as well as maintaining my social media presence, as this is also one of 
  my income sources.
  
</p>    
        
<h2>How and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
<p>By being active in slack and the groups I'm apart of. 
  Also by seeking out help from classmates when necessary.

<h2>My learning plan</h2>
<h3>How I can make the most of EDA</h3>
    <ol>Being intentional about my study: What do I want to achieve? What will be taught this spring? What will be in the next sprint? Hw can I best prepare my mind and my time for those things?</ol>
    <ol>Visualisation</ol>
    <ol>Getting over myself and asking for help from my peers</ol>
    <ol>Being ok with not being an expert right now</ol>
    <ol>Staying hungry for learning and keepingthe fire lit</ol>
    <ol>Working hard outside the regular scheduled class hours</ol>
    <ol>More focus on planning the task in my mind before going to my laptop</ol>
    <ol>Keeping it moving, even if I get stuck, move on to something else and keep the momentum high</ol>
    <ol>After having learnt something new, recall the steps in my mind as to how I did it step by step</ol>
    <ol>Not getting caught up on not getting things right now, and being certain that I just don't fully get it YET, but I'll get there...and watch out when I do</ol>
