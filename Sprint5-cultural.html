         Key Questions:
        </h2>
    <h2>1. Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.
           
    </h2> 
    <p> Core learning has provided my learning with the kind of balance that I think I needed coming into something that was so foreign to me. 
        It has allowed me to use tools to push myself when I felt like I didn't want to, or couldn't quite get a concept.
    </p>

    <h2>
    2. What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>

    <p> 1. I am a great listener.
        2. I am capable of everything, even those things I haven't figured out yet
        3. I struggle with keeping to time if I feel like something isn't up to my standard.

    </p>

    <h2>
    3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    
    </h2>

    <p>
        The thing that surprised me the most is that working with others was actually quite nice.
    </p>

    <h2>
        4.What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        
    </h2>

    <p>
        Core learning modules are usually done after the technical modules in a sprint. Quite often I found myself quickly trying to rush 
        the core component. This sprint is a little different, but generally I struggled to ensure that the core component was not rushed. 
    </p>

    <h2>5.Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</h2>

    <p>
        Yes. It was enjoyable having core as a refreshing change of pace after the technical part of the sprint.
