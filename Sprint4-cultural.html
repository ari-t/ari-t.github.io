<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

<p>A growth mindset is one focussed on possibility and potential. 
    There is no room for failure because failure doesn't exist.</p>

<p>This sprint was the most difficult one yet. I got error message after error message and felt I had burnt out 100 times.
    With this many 'failures', normally, I would have abandoned the task I was performing altogether and probably email Jack and 
    demand an immediate withdrawal.I would be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind.
    I'd also be lying if I said that all it took was watching one Ted talk to change the way I felt and have always felt about failure and success.
    I see this as something that I have to practice and slowly develop over time.
It was hard. One morning I was in front of my laptop at 2am on one of the kata challenges trying to reassure myself over and over that I was going to do it...but I just got angry because it still didn't change what I didn't know.
It was just another lesson for me that it's one thing to know something and another thing to practice it. But I'll get there.

<p>It's really funny. I did a lot of research to answer this question, I had a generic URL I was about to link; but as I am typing this, I'm listening to an
     audiobook about growing wealth that is talking about this precise issue right now. Maybe it's a sign. Chapter 5 of Jen Sincero's 'You are a Badass at Making Money'
     summarises the growth mindset eloquently and in the most relevant way possible. I don't have a link for the book, but you can 
     purchase it much cheaper than anywhere else <a href= https://www.bookdepository.com/You-Are-a-Badass-at-Making-Money-Jen-Sincero/9781473649569?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=NZ&utm_content=You-Are-a-Badass-at-Making-Money&selectCurrency=NZD&w=AF7CAU96QQF03JA8095X&pdg=pla-308360991107:kwd-308360991107:cmp-947803846:adg-45233890777:crv-225027758856:pid-9781473649569:dev-c&gclid=CjwKCAiA9K3gBRA4EiwACEhFewtESs_5kvT27Yxm327ynukv3SCEY1leS1yTKiIqgXJf4YXWTfyPNRoC56EQAvD_BwE;>

<p>It will be a good idea to go back and revise my learning plan to include some of the more salient points.</p>

<h2>Things I will include in my new learning plan</h2>
<p><ul>Visualisation</ul>
    <ul>Keeping it moving, even if I get stuck, move on to something else and keep the momentum high</ul>
    <ul>After having learnt something new, recall the steps in my mind as to how I did it step by step</ul>
