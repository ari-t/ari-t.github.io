<h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplaticity benefits people </h2>
      //  Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplaticity for your own benefit
        //What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplaticity
        //Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
        
<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
//Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
<p>A growth mindset is one focussed on possibility and potential. There is no room for failure because failure doesn't exist.</p>
//In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
<p>I wished I had started with the cultural tasks before the technical part. 
    It would probably have been a good source of encouragement as I struggled through the tasks.</p>
//How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
<p>With a growth mindset I'll be less harsh on myself and less critical of the content.</p>
//Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
<p>I am fortunate enough to have a running subscription to the BossBabe Societe which has some fantastic resources on 
    the growth mindset. I only really was motivated to look at them after this challenge.
</p>
<p>Now that I have this understanding, I can go back and revise my learning plan to include some of the more salient points.</p>
//Blend with your learning plan and strategies

//Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
