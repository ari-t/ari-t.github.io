  <h2><strong> Part One:</strong> <br> Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h2>

  <p>I am someone who is very ambitious, driven, independent and creative.
    </p>
  <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
    </h2>

<p>Honesty is a very important thing for me. 
    A friend of mine made a purchase on her credit card using my computer, which then autosaved her card number. 
    We had a falling out amongst our friends and later on when I was making a purchase, a friend who happened to be at my house saw her credit card number pop up as an option in my shopping cart. 
    She toyed with the idea of using it for our purchase as payback for the emotional damage to our friendship. I couldn’t do it at the time. 
    I won't lie though, sometimes I look back on that like "Where was my YOLO?!"...just kidding. 
    </p>

<h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
    </h2>
<p>As a Maori I have learnt the importance of listening more than I speak. 
    I think this has been a massive strength for me in my life. I’ve been able to fly under the radar and really learn so much.</p>    
        
<h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>
<p>The 16 personalities test tells my I am ENTP, like Tyrion Lannister. My strengths include my keen intellect and wit, my creativity, my ability to look at a situation from all angles possible. 
        My limitations includes the fact that my moral compass doesn’t seem to consider other people’s feelings (Although I think I’m quite compassionate), and that I sometimes pursue things out of mere boredom and not because I am invested in any particular cause.
        </p>

<h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
    </h2>
<p>Whenever my WoF and rego needs to be renewed, 
    I once again have a serious dilemma in having to decide whether I should pay to get it renewed or leave it in the hands of the gods.
I weighed up the decision by thinking about karma and knowing that the very day my rego clocks out, I'll probably get pulled over at a cop stop.</p>

<br>

<h2><strong>Part Two:</strong><br> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
    </h2>
<p>My strengths mean I am a quick learner and I can power through any task. My limitation is definitely follow-through over a long period of time. 
  The reason I took this course instead of a university degree is because I was worried that if it were more than a year, I would not keep the fire burning. 
    </p>

<h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
    </h2>
<p>My limitation is that because I am so creative and such a powerhouse, my attention span is short and I can become bored quite easily. 
    This means that my effort is more like spurts of energy that can putter out over a long period of time.
    </p>

<h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
    Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
    </h2>
<p>I had a group presentation for a PR class at uni. We had students of all levels including international students whose english was quite poor. 
    The tension wasn’t so much of a tension as it was an inability to communicate. 
    We just went over their heads and did their portion of the work for them just to be able to hand in an assignment of quality. 
    We got the grade we wanted, but admittedly this was not the best approach. 
    If the situation were to be repeated, I would take more collaborative approach to the assignment.</p>
